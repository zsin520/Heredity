# Heredity

Mutation of the GJB2 gene is one of the leading causes of hearing impairment in newborns. One gene from each of the parents is inherited by the child. A Bayesian Network of all variables is used to model the relationships between mother, father, parent, child. 

A model is created that uses information about a population: information about people, who their parents are, and whether they have an observable trait caused by the GJB2 gene. The model will infer probability distribution for each person's GJB2 gene, as well as probability distribution if they exhibit the trait.
